In this project, import and exports are used. There are different files used for the code and assets. Webpack is used to bundle them all together. The HTML elements are generated via Javascript, and each part separated into modules to make the code more organized. The style sheet is separate as usual. The html attributes and long text strings are also put in different files. A tab switching feature is also added. It involves appending and removing a whole section from the DOM, which makes good use of the sections being separated into modules and all html elements being generated by Javascript.
